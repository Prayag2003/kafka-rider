     cd kafka-rider
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```makefile
     npm install
   ``` 

4. Create a .env file based on the provided .env.sample and replace <YOUR_PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS> with your private IP address.
   ```env
     PRIVATE_IP=<YOUR_PRIVATE_IP_ADDRESS>
     KAFKA_PORT=9092
   ```

  ## Running a Consumer Group with a Single Consumer
  
  To run a consumer group with a single consumer, follow these steps:
  
  1. Open another terminal.
  2. Run the following command:
  
      ```bash
      node src/consumer.js usergroup-1
      ```

  ## Running Two Consumer Groups
  
  To run two consumer groups, follow these steps:
  
  1. Open one more terminal.
  2. Run the following command:
  
      ```bash
      node src/consumer.js usergroup-2
      ```
      ![2 Consumer Group](./readme-images/consumer-group-2.webp)
  
  ## Auto-Balancing
     Auto-balancing is a feature of Kafka consumer groups that ensures an even distribution of partitions among the consumers within 
     the group. When a new consumer joins a consumer group or an existing consumer leaves the group, Kafka automatically reassigns
     partitions among the remaining consumers to maintain a balanced workload.
